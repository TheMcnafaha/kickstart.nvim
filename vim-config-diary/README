Mistakes were made. I now have two gits: the git containing my init file, and the git contining the greater kickstart repo.

Now I have two init files because the kickstart repo also has its own init that I was meant to use (followed video instead of reading repo).

I have two main solutions:
	1) Copy the upper init into the kickstart init, and run two git instances 
	2) Clear this dir and start over with kickstart, but replacing their init with my, and upper, init

Pros of 1:
	1. No deltion

Cons of 1:
	1. Two gits, and two inits

Pros of 2:
	1. the correct setup
	2. one init

Cons of 2:
	1. I have to nuke this dir

Because I'm pretty early into my vim life, day two in fact, I going with 2.

	- old bug about lua config is gone
	- actually ran on first try

Now all i need is to replace this init with my init
